                        Win SCP is a software used to monitor files by using Secured File Transfer Protocol(SFTP).
                        It is used to check files transferred from SAP server to Dealer Management System(DMS) and DMS
                        to SAP. Files all are generated from SAP by web methods. I have to schedule task for files by
                        priority wise in web methods. For example Invoice files are generated every one hour out of
                        24 hours. During month end, large numbers of files need to be pushed from SAP to DMS.
                        At that time some problem may arise in the file generation and files may not be generated
                        automatically from SAP. I need to rectify the issues and run back web methods and send
                        files to DMS and monitor whether invoice files are uploaded in DMS.
                        Parts, pricing, HSN tax files and many other files were generated automatically from
                        SAP and went to DMS periodically. This process for outbound files.
                        Next is inbound files which are generated from DMS and posted to SAP through web methods.
                        These files also generated in large numbers during month end and needs to be pushed to SAP.

                        SAP stands for Systems, Applications & Products in Data Processing.
                        SAP is a German software and has many types(SAP FICO, SAP SD, SAP ABAB, etc.)
                        Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a software used to manage datas of various

                        Datas are transferred database to SAP and SAP to database.
                        It is used to generate files from data present in SAP tables automatically using web methods.
                        Sent the generated files to dealer server. And also receive files from dealer server and post
                        the datas present in files to SAP. Each type of information are stored as tables and
                        can be viewed in computer with the help of SAP application.
                        Data can be checked, generated and can be edited with particular codes.
                        Some tables are not accessible for beginner workers. Some tables were given access for
                        only senior workers. Editable tables were given access for important senior workers.
                        SAP tables basically contains information about products, rates, delivery date, retail date,

                    <h5>JavaScript</h5>
                    JavaScript is used to add functionality to web elements. There are three main parts in JS.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Synchronous JS</li>
                        <li>Asynchronous JS</li>
                        <li>Window and Document Object Model</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Synchronous JS unblocks only when cuurent task is completed. Examples: basic codes, functions,
                        loops, conditions are Synchronous. Asynchronous JS execution starts in parallel without
                        blocking. But execution finishese one by one. Examples of Asynchronous are timers,
                        promises and thenables. Async and await has synchronous behavior but works asynchronously.
                        Await wait for promise to resolve and async function always return promise.
                        Window object have many inbuilt methods such as alert, console, print, prompt, open, etc.
                        By using document object model(DOM), we can take elements, set attributes, text content, append
                        child and also give styles.

                    <h5>React JS</h5>
                    <p>
                        In Js, accessing DOM is slow when there are many nested elements present in html. So facebook
                        introduced React which uses Virtual DOM.Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of actual DOM
                        present as JS object in memory. When a state is changed react take snapshot of virtual DOM befor
                        update and then virtual DOM updated. Then react compares the virtual DOM snapshot and updated
                        virtual DOM. This process is called diffing. ReactDOM updates only the changed state without
                        refreshing entire page. Only the changed content is updated. This is called reconciliation.
                        React makes use of JSX(JavaScript XML) to write HIML inside JS file of React.
                        There are two types of component in React, Class and Functional components.
                        Before version 16.8, state can be defined and updated using class component only. But in class
                        component, code strcuture is large. So in October 2018 at React conference, react hooks
                        was introduced for to include states in functional components.
                        Then after that code size reduced considerably. Advantages of React are speed, code reusability,
                        easier to debug using React Developer tools.

                    TAFE(Tractors And Farm Equipment limited) manufactures tractors, parts, store oil and eicher
                    vehicles. I had joined as Project Assinee in Dealer Management System.
                    Two flow of datas needs to be monitored. First one is outflow of data from SAP to dealers:
                    reconciliation of data from SAP to Dealer server for Invoices of tractors and dealers,
                    parts, oil, rollout new dealers, control unit mapping for dealers and workers,
                    pricing and warranty. Second flow from dealer server to SAP: status files such delivery,
                    retail, delivery return, retail return, sale order, purchase order and
                    service invoice files came from dealer server and transferred through
                    SFTP(Secured File Transfer Protocol) and posted to SAP by Remote Function Call(RFC).

                    I was joined in SrinSoft Technologies in April 1<sup>st</sup> as a Software Trainee. Training was
                    given on JS concepts(synchronous and asynchronous programming) and React JS.
                    In a project called TES-$-pricing, tasks were assigned to me.
                    First task was fetching data from API using React JS for
                    particular columns in the tables. Next task was React Popover when a user clicks
                    on a particular elements in the coloumn. Also fetch data to the
                    elements present in popover.

                    In college, I have done mini project named Tone generator control using 555 timer is used to produce
                    a range of sounds. It is used to generate waves like triangle, square, sawtooth & sine wave.
                    By handling the two potentiometers of the tone generator,
                    you can change the oscillation frequencies of the two 555 timers
                    that work as astable multivibrators, thus generating different sounds. Used to convert
                    electrical signal to audio.

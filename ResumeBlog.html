                footer, etc.
                Non-semantic elements does not have meaning about its content when used. Examples: div and span.

                <h5>JavaScript</h5>
                JavaScript is used to add functionality to web elements. There are three main parts in JS.
                <ol>
                    <li>Synchronous JS</li>
                    <li>Asynchronous JS</li>
                    <li>Window and Document Object Model</li>
                </ol>
                Synchronous JS unblocks only when cuurent task is completed. Examples: basic codes, functions, loops,
                conditions
                are Synchronous.
                Asynchronous JS execution starts in parallel without blocking. But execution finishese one by one.
                Examples of Asynchronous are timers, promises and thenables. Async and await has synchronous behavior
                but
                works
                asynchronously.
                Await wait for promise to resolve and async function always return promise.
                Window object have many inbuilt methods such as alert, console, print, prompt, open, etc.
                By using document object model(DOM), we can take elements, set attributes, text content, append child
                and
                also
                give styles.

            </div>
            <div class="reactJs">
                <h5>React JS</h5>
                In Js, accessing DOM is slow when there are many nested elements present in html. So facebook introduced
                React
                which uses Virtual DOM.Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of actual DOM present as JS object in memory.
                When
                a
                state is changed react take snapshot of virtual DOM befor update and then virtual DOM updated. Then
                react
                compares
                the virtual DOM snapshot and updated virtual DOM. This process is called diffing. ReactDOM updates only
                the
                changed
                state without refreshing entire page. Only the changed content is updated. This is called
                reconciliation.

                React makes use of JSX(JavaScript XML) to write HIML inside JS file of React.
                There are two types of component in React, Class and Functional components.
                Before version 16.8, state can be defined and updated using class component only. But in class
                component,
                code
                strcuture is large.
                So in October 2018 at React conference, react hooks was introduced for to include states in functional
                components.
                Then after that code size reduced considerably.
                Advantages of React are speed, code reusability, easier to debug using React Developer tools.

            I had joined as Project Assinee in Dealer Management System. Two flow of datas needs to be monitored.
            First one is outflow of data from SAP to dealers: reconciliation of data from SAP to Dealer server for
            Invoices of tractors and dealers, parts, oil, rollout new dealers, control unit mapping for dealers and
            workers,
            pricing and warranty.
            Second flow from dealer server to SAP: status files such delivery, retail, delivery return, retail return,
            sale
            order, purchase order and service invoice files came from dealer server and transferred through SFTP(Secured
            File Transfer Protocol) and posted to SAP by Remote Function Call(RFC).

            JS
            concepts(synchronous and asynchronous programming) and React JS. In a project called TES-$-pricing, tasks
            were
            assigned to me. First task was fetching data from API using React JS for particular coloumns in the tables.
            Next task was React Popover when a user clicks on a particular elements in the coloumn. Also fetch data to
            the
            elements present in popover.

            <h4>Projects</h4>
            <h5>Tone generator control using 555 timer</h5>
            In college, I have done mini project named Tone generator control using 555 timer is used to produce a range
            of
            sounds.
            By handling the two potentiometers of the tone generator, you can change the oscillation frequencies of the
            two
            555 timers
            that work as astable multivibrators, thus generating different sounds. Used to convert electrical signal to
            audio.
            <h5>High speed carry skip adder using AOI and OAI skip logic</h5>
            This project is used to increase speed for carry skip adder present in processor. In normal carry skip
            adder,
            multiplexer is used
            for carry skip logic. In this project, And Or Invert and Or And Invert logic is used to decrease the area
            and
            delay of skip logic.

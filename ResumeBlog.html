                        Win SCP is a software used to monitor files by using Secured File Transfer Protocol(SFTP).
                        It is used to check files transferred from SAP server to Dealer Management System(DMS) and DMS
                        to SAP. Files all are generated from SAP by web methods. I have to schedule task for files by
                        priority wise in web methods. For example Invoice files are generated every one hour out of
                        24 hours. During month end, large numbers of files need to be pushed from SAP to DMS.
                        At that time some problem may arise in the file generation and files may not be generated
                        automatically from SAP. I need to rectify the issues and run back web methods and send
                        files to DMS and monitor whether invoice files are uploaded in DMS.
                        Parts, pricing, HSN tax files and many other files were generated automatically from
                        SAP and went to DMS periodically. This process for outbound files.
                        Next is inbound files which are generated from DMS and posted to SAP through web methods.
                        These files also generated in large numbers during month end and needs to be pushed to SAP.

                        SAP stands for Systems, Applications & Products in Data Processing.
                        SAP is a German software and has many types(SAP FICO, SAP SD, SAP ABAB, etc.)
                        Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a software used to manage datas of various
                        departments such as accounts, procurement, project management, supply chain management.
                        Datas are transferred database to SAP and SAP to database.
                        It is used to generate files from data present in SAP tables automatically using web methods.
                        Sent the generated files to dealer server. And also receive files from dealer server and post
                        the datas present in files to SAP. Each type of information are stored as tables and
                        can be viewed in computer with the help of SAP application.
                        Data can be checked, generated and can be edited with particular codes.
                        Some tables are not accessible for beginner workers. Some tables were given access for
                        only senior workers. Editable tables were given access for important senior workers.
                        SAP tables basically contains information about products, rates, delivery date, retail date,
                        size, weight, warranty, tax and dealer information.

                        HTML is used to display just a content. There are 2 types of tag elements present in HTMl.
                        First one is semantic elements and second is non-semantic elements.
                        Semantic elements has purpose by its names. Examples: header, article, iframe, footer, etc.
                        Non-semantic elements does not have meaning about its content when used. Examples: div and span.
                        HTML elements are available as nodes in Document Object Model(DOM). DOM is represented as
                        Tree structures. Block elements should not be placed under <em>paragraph</em> tag.
                        If block elements are placed inside paragraph, then the elements inside paragraph will become
                        global and styles applied to paragraphs are not applied to block child elements.

                        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. CSS is used for applying styles and make them as
                        responsive. CSS has many properties includes display, color and background, position, padding,
                        margin, width, border, box-sizing, etc. CSS have priority for elements,
                        classes, id, *(universal selector) and inline styles. * => tag => classes => id
                        => inline styles. * is least priority and inline styles has higher priority.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear</li>
                        <li>Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent</li>
                        <li>Border - A border that goes around the padding and content</li>
                        <li>Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent</li>

                    <b>Box sizing border box</b>
                    <p>
                        CSS border-box is the most popular choice for setting box-sizing . It guarantees that the
                        content box shrinks to make space for the padding and borders. Therefore, if you set your
                        element width to 200 pixels, border-box makes sure that the content, padding, and borders fit in
                        this number.

                    <h5>JavaScript</h5>
                    JavaScript is used to add functionality to web elements. There are three main parts in JS.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Synchronous JS</li>
                        <li>Asynchronous JS</li>
                        <li>Window and Document Object Model</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Synchronous JS unblocks only when cuurent task is completed. Examples: basic codes, functions,
                        loops, conditions are Synchronous. Asynchronous JS execution starts in parallel without
                        blocking. But execution finishese one by one. Examples of Asynchronous are timers,
                        promises and thenables. Async and await has synchronous behavior but works asynchronously.
                        Await wait for promise to resolve and async function always return promise.
                        Window object have many inbuilt methods such as alert, console, print, prompt, open, etc.
                        By using document object model(DOM), we can take elements, set attributes, text content, append
                        child and also give styles.

                        There are 2 types of data types. Primitive and complex data types.
                        Primitive datatypes consist of number, booleon, string, symbol,
                        undefined, and null. Complex data types consist of arrays,
                        object and functions.

                    <h5>React JS</h5>
                    <p>
                        In Js, accessing DOM is slow when there are many nested elements present in html. So facebook
                        introduced React which uses Virtual DOM.Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of actual DOM
                        present as JS object in memory. When a state is changed react take snapshot of virtual DOM befor
                        update and then virtual DOM updated. Then react compares the virtual DOM snapshot and updated
                        virtual DOM. This process is called diffing. ReactDOM updates only the changed state without
                        refreshing entire page. Only the changed content is updated. This is called reconciliation.
                        React makes use of JSX(JavaScript XML) to write HIML inside JS file of React.
                        There are two types of component in React, Class and Functional components.
                        Before version 16.8, state can be defined and updated using class component only. But in class
                        component, code strcuture is large. So in October 2018 at React conference, react hooks
                        was introduced for to include states in functional components.
                        Then after that code size reduced considerably. Advantages of React are speed, code reusability,
                        easier to debug using React Developer tools.

                    <p>
                        Important concepts of React are conditional rendering, hooks, rendering different types of
                        datatypes and JS like primitive values, arrays, objects and promise, routers, state and props,
                        components, and lifecyle. React redux is used to maintain data and React JS is just a view
                        layer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We must need to know atleast basic 5 hooks such as useState, useEffect, useContext, useMemo
                        and useCallback. State updation is done by useState. useEffect have three usecases.
                        When dependency array is empty, then useEffect executes only at the beginning of loading.
                        When a dependency array has any state, whenever the state change happens, useEffect
                        executes. When there is no dependency array, then useEffect for executes for each
                        render. useContext hook is used to send data between nested components and also
                        avoid prop drilling. Difference between useContext and redux, redux is used to maintain
                        data and store state and initial state not mutated. Redux change the state by
                        creating the reference and change that reference. But useContext just pass the state from
                        one component to another and also mutates the state when state changes.
                        useMemo and useCallback is used to prevent unnecessary renders.

                        Redux is an open source javaScript library used for state management and centralizing
                        application states. Redux have important concepts such as store, action, reducer,
                        subscribe, dispatch, connect, provider, mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps.
                        A store is an immutable object tree in Redux. A store is a state container which holds the
                        application's state. Redux can have only a single store in your application. Whenever a store is
                        created in Redux, you need to specify the reducer.
                        Actions are the only source of information for the store as per Redux official documentation. It
                        carries a payload of information from your application to store. As discussed earlier, actions
                        are plain JavaScript object that must have a type attribute to indicate the type of action
                        performed.In Redux, a reducer is a pure function that takes an action and the previous state of
                        the application and returns the new state. The action describes what happened and it is the
                        reducer's job to return the new state based on that action. dispatch is a function of the Redux
                        store. You call store. dispatch to dispatch an action. This is the only way to trigger a state
                        change. With React Redux, your components never access the store directly - connect does it for
                        you. The connect() function connects a React component to a Redux store. It provides its
                        connected component with the pieces of the data it needs from the store, and the functions it
                        can use to dispatch actions to the store. In Redux, subscriptions are called after the root
                        reducer has returned the new state, so you may dispatch in the subscription listeners. You are
                        only disallowed to dispatch inside the reducers because they must have no side effects.
                        Providing a mapDispatchToProps allows you to specify which actions your component might need to
                        dispatch. It lets you provide action dispatching functions as props. Therefore, instead of
                        calling props. The mapStateToProps function is used in the Redux pattern to reflect any updates
                        to the Redux store and merge them into props in your component. The Redux store serves as a
                        centralized place for the state to live in your application.

                    TAFE(Tractors And Farm Equipment limited) manufactures tractors, parts, store oil and eicher
                    vehicles. I had joined as Project Assinee in Dealer Management System.
                    Two flow of datas needs to be monitored. First one is outflow of data from SAP to dealers:
                    reconciliation of data from SAP to Dealer server for Invoices of tractors and dealers,
                    parts, oil, rollout new dealers, control unit mapping for dealers and workers,
                    pricing and warranty. Second flow from dealer server to SAP: status files such delivery,
                    retail, delivery return, retail return, sale order, purchase order and
                    service invoice files came from dealer server and transferred through
                    SFTP(Secured File Transfer Protocol) and posted to SAP by Remote Function Call(RFC).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Roll out process for dealers were also done by my team. There were 6 types of files needs
                    to be generated. Village master mapping files generated to map dealer informations like
                    dealer location and sales area were given. Next dealer master file was generated to
                    map key part dealers with dealers. Vehicle master files were generated for each dealers.
                    Then finally dealers were made DMS dealers in specific SAP tables. After that, I need to
                    check other dealer table in SAP whether marked dealers were made DMS. I have to
                    inform to backend data team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tractors data were first generated in SAP with random serial numbers, gate entry date,
                    dealers and vehicle numbers. When gate exit done, invoice files were generated for gate
                    exited vehicles for every one hour. This status is known as ST1 status.
                    Then the tractors moved to floorstock of dealer's area and vehicle master file is generated
                    as ST2 status. Sale order files are generated once the product's price given by dealers.
                    When customer buys tractor, dealers were delivered the tractors to customers. This status
                    is ST5. When the customer fully pay the prize then the tractor is in retailed status that
                    is ST6. And also delivery and retail files were automatically generated from DMS server to
                    posted to SAP through SFTP(Secured File Transfer Protocol).

                    In a project called TES-$-pricing, tasks were assigned to me.
                    First task was fetching data from API using React JS for
                    particular columns in the tables. Next task was React Popover when a user clicks
                    on a particular elements in the coloumn. Also fetch data to the
                    elements present in popover.

                    I have done todo application using redux and write unit testing using React
                    testing library. I had done tic tac toe(X/O game) using React Js and
                    also write unit testing. I have practised on React basic hooks. I had written
                    unit test code for asynchronous javaScript in react testing library.
                    I had displayed movies image and title from movie DB API and write unit

                    In college, I have done mini project named Tone generator control using 555 timer is used to produce
                    a range of sounds. It is used to generate waves like triangle, square, sawtooth & sine wave.
                    By handling the two potentiometers of the tone generator,
                    you can change the oscillation frequencies of the two 555 timers
                    that work as astable multivibrators, thus generating different sounds. Used to convert
                    electrical signal to audio.

                <h4>Working</h4>
                <p>
                    The operation of this circuit is based around the working principle of a self-triggering oscillator
                    (astable multivibrator), performed by a 555 timer circuit (NE555). When the circuit is
                    powered on, The values of resistors (R1, R2) & capacitors (C1, C2) on the left side of the circuit
                    set the pitch of the output tone coming from the audio transducer (loudspeaker), including a
                    variable resistor (potentiometer) serving as our pitch control.
                    The capacitor (C2) to the far left filters out as much noise or undesired operation of the
                    potentiometer due to which we get a smooth pitch change whilst adjusting. This circuit can be
                    operated from as little as 6V to up to 12 V power supply.
                    Astable Multivibrator circuit mode for 555 timer IC is also called Free running or self-triggering
                    mode. It doesn't have any stable state ie has two quasi-stable states (HIGH & LOW). No external
                    triggering is required in Astable mode, it automatically interchanges its two states on a particular
                    interval, hence generates a rectangular waveform. So in this tutorial, we are going to make “Astable
                    Multivibrator using 555 Timer“. Watch the video for Step by Step instructions
                    An astable multivibrator is a free-running oscillator that switches continuously between its two
                    unstable states. With no external signal applied, the transistors alternately switch from cutoff to
                    saturation state at a frequency that RC time constants of the coupling circuit determine. If these
                    time constants are equal (R and C are equal) then a square wave will generate with a frequency of
                    1/1.4 RxC. Hence, an astable multivibrator is also a pulse generator or a square wave generator.

                <h4>Abstraction</h4>
                <p>
                    This project is used to increase speed for carry skip adder present in processor.
                    In normal carry skip adder, multiplexer is used for carry skip logic.
                    In this project, And Or Invert and Or And Invert logic is used to decrease the
                    area and delay of skip logic.
                </p>
                <h4>Adders</h4>
                <p>
                    Adders are a key building block in arithmetic and logic units and hence
                    increasing their speed and reducing their power/energy consumption strongly
                    affect the speed and power consumption of processors. There are many works on
                    the subject of optimizing the speed and power of these units, which have been
                    reported. Obviously, it is highly desirable to achieve higher speeds at low-
                    power/energy consumptions which is a challenge for the designers of general
                    purpose processors. One of the effective techniques to lower the power
                    consumption of digital circuits is to reduce the supply voltage due to quadratic
                    dependence of the switching energy on the voltage. Moreover, the subthreshold
                    current, which is the main leakage component in OFF devices has an exponential
                    dependence on the supply voltage level through the drain-induced barrier lowering
                    effect. Depending on the Amount of the supply voltage reduction, the operation of
                    ON devices may reside in the superthreshold, near-threshold or subthreshold
                    regions. Working in the superthreshold region provides us with lower delay and
                    higher switching and leakage powers compared with the near/subthreshold regions.
                    In the subthreshold region, the logic gate delay and leakage power exhibit
                    exponential dependences on the supply and threshold voltages. Moreover, these
                    voltages are subject to process and environmental variations in the nanoscale
                    technologies. The variations increase uncertainties in the aforesaid performance
                    parameters. In addition, the small subthreshold Current causes a large delay for the
                    circuits operating in the subthreshold region. Recently, the near-threshold region
                    has been considered as a region that provides a more desirable tradeoff point
                    1between delay and power dissipation compared with that of the subthreshold one
                    because it results in lower delay compared with the subthreshold region and
                    significantly lowers switching and leakage powers compared with the
                    superthreshold region. In addition, near-threshold operation which uses supply
                    voltage levels near the threshold voltage of transistors suffers considerably less
                    from the process and environmental variations compared with the subthreshold
                    region.

                <h4>Scope of the project</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In this paper, we present a carry skip adder (CSKA) structure that has a higher
                        speed yet lower energy consumption compared with the conventional one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The speed enhancement is achieved by applying concatenation and
                        incrementation schemes to improve the efficiency of the conventional CSKA
                        (Conv-CSKA) structure. In addition, instead of utilizing multiplexer logic, the
                        proposed structure makes use of AND-OR-Invert (AOI) and OR-AND-Invert
                        (OAI) compound gates for the skip logic.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The proposed structures are assessed by comparing their speed, power and
                        energy parameters with those of other adders using a 45-nm static CMOS
                        technology for a wide range of supply voltages.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Simulations on the proposed hybrid variable latency CSKA reveal reduction in
                        the power consumption compared with the latest works in this field while
                        having a reasonably high speed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Delay optimization</h4>
                <p>
                    The worst-case carry propagation delays in carry-skip adders and block
                    carry-look ahead adders depend on how the full adders are grouped structurally
                    together into blocks as well as the number of levels. The authors report on a
                    multidimensional dynamic programming paradigm for configuring these two
                    adders to attain minimum latency. Previous methods are applicable only to very
                    limited delay models that do not guarantee a minimum latency configuration.
                    Under the delay model, critical path delay is calculated not only taking into
                    account the intrinsic gate delays, but also the fanin and fanout contributions.

                <p>
                    Xilinx ISE (Integrated Synthesis Environment) is a software tool produced
                    by Xilinx for synthesis and analysis of HDL designs, enabling the developer
                    to synthesize("compile") their designs, perform timing analysis,
                    examine RTL diagrams, simulate a design's reaction to different stimuli and
                    configure the target device with the programmer. Xilinx ISE is a design
                    environment for FPGA products from Xilinx, and is tightly-coupled to the
                    architecture of such chips and cannot be used with FPGA products from other
                    vendors. The Xilinx ISE is primarily used for circuit synthesis and design while
                    ISIM or the ModelSim logic simulator is used for system-level testing.

                    Multiplexer is used as Skip logic in Conventional Carry Skip Adder.It is a
                    device that selects one of everal analog or digital input signals and forwards the
                    selected input into a single line. A multiplexer of 2n inputs has n select lines,
                    which are used to select which input line to send to the output. Multiplexers are
                    mainly used to increase the amount of data that can be sent over the network within
                    a certain amount of time and bandwidth A multiplexer is also called a data selector.

                    The structure is based on combining
                    the concatenation and the incrementation schemes with the Conv-CSKA structure,
                    and hence, is denoted by CI-CSKA. It provides us with the ability to use simpler
                    carry skip logics. The logic replaces 2:1 multiplexers by AOI/OAI compound gates.
                    The gates which consist of fewer transistors have lower delay, area and smaller
                    power consumption compared with those of the 2:1 multiplexer. Note that in this
                    structure as the carry propagates through the skip logics, it becomes complemented.
                    Therefore, at the output of the skip logic of even stages, the complement of the
                    carry is generated.

                    the power consumptions of the AOI (or OAI) gate are smaller than that of the
                    multiplexer, the power consumption of the proposed CI-CSKA is a little more than
                    that of the conventional one. This is due to the increase in the number of the gates
                    which imposes a higher wiring capacitance.

                    The use of the static AOI and OAI gates (six transistors) compared with the
                    static 2:1 multiplexer (12 transistors), leads to decreases in the area usage and
                    delay of the skip logic.To calculate the delay of the skip logic, the average of the
                    delays of the AOI and OAI gates, which are typically close to one another.

                <p>
                    The reason for using both AOI and OAI compound gates as the skip logics is the
                    inverting functions of these gates in standard cell libraries. If an AOI is used as the
                    skip logic, the next skip logic should use OAI gate.

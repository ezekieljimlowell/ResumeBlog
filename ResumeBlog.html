    <p class="winScp">
        Win SCP is a software used to monitor files by using Secured File Transfer Protocol(SFTP).
        It is used to check files transferred from SAP server to Dealer Management System and viceversa.
    </p>
    <p class="SAP">
        SAP stands for Systems, Applications & Products in Data Processing.
        It is used to generate files from datas present SAP tables automatically using web methods.
        Sent the generated files to dealer server. And also receive files from dealer server and post the datas present
        in files to SAP.
    </p>
    <p class="html">
        HTML is used to display just a content. There are 2 types of tag elements present in HTMl. First one is semantic
        elements and
        second is non-semantic elements. Semantic elements has purpose by its names. Examples: header, article, iframe,
        footer, etc.
        Non-semantic elements does not have meaning about its content when used. Examples: div and span.
    </p>
    <p class="css">
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. CSS is used for applying styles and make them as responsive.
        CSS has many properties includes display, color and background, position, padding, margin, width, border,
        box-sizing, etc.
        CSS have priority for elements, classes, id, *(universal selector) and inline styles. * => tag => classes => id
        => inline styles.
        * is least priority and inline styles has higher priority.
        Responsive design given by flex, bootstrap and media queries.
    </p>
    <p class="JavaScript">
        JavaScript is used to add functionality to web elements. There are three main parts in JS.
    <ol>
        <li>Synchronous JS</li>
        <li>Asynchronous JS</li>
        <li>Window and Document Object Model</li>
    </ol>
    Synchronous JS unblocks only when cuurent task is completed. Examples: basic codes, functions, loops, conditions
    are Synchronous.
    Asynchronous JS execution starts in parallel without blocking. But execution finishese one by one.
    Examples of Asynchronous are timers, promises and thenables. Async and await has synchronous behavior but works
    asynchronously.
    Await wait for promise to resolve and async function always return promise.
    Window object have many inbuilt methods such as alert, console, print, prompt, open, etc.
    By using document object model(DOM), we can take elements, set attributes, text content, append child and also
    give styles.
    </p>
    <p class="reactJs">
        In Js, accessing DOM is slow when there are many nested elements present in html. So facebook introduced React
        which uses Virtual DOM.Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of actual DOM present as JS object in memory. When a
        state is changed react take snapshot of virtual DOM befor update and then virtual DOM updated. Then react
        compares
        the virtual DOM snapshot and updated virtual DOM. This process is called diffing. ReactDOM updates only the
        changed
        state without refreshing entire page. Only the changed content is updated. This is called reconciliation.

        React makes use of JSX(JavaScript XML) to write HIML inside JS file of React.
        There are two types of component in React, Class and Functional components.
        Before version 16.8, state can be defined and updated using class component only. But in class component, code
        strcuture is large.
        So in October 2018 at React conference, react hooks was introduced for to include states in functional
        components.
        Then after that code size reduced considerably.
        Advantages of React are speed, code reusability, easier to debug using React Developer tools.

    <p class="tafe">
        TAFE(Tractors And Farm Equipment limited) manufactures tractors, parts, store oil and eicher vehicles.
        I had joined as Project Assinee in Dealer Management System. Two flow of datas needs to be monitored.
        First one is outflow of data from SAP to dealers: reconciliation of data from SAP to Dealer server for
        Invoices of tractors and dealers, parts, oil, rollout new dealers, control unit mapping for dealers and workers,
        pricing and warranty.
        Second flow from dealer server to SAP: status files such delivery, retail, delivery return, retail return, sale
        order, purchase order and service invoice files came from dealer server and transferred through SFTP(Secured
        File Transfer Protocol) and posted to SAP by Remote Function Call(RFC).

    <p class="srinsoft">
        I was joined in SrinSoft Technologies in April 1<sup>st</sup> as a Software Trainee. Training was given on JS
        concepts(synchronous and asynchronous programming) and React JS. In a project called TES-$-pricing, tasks were
        assigned to me. First task was fetching data from API using React JS for particular coloumns in the tables.
        Next task was React Popover when a user clicks on a particular elements in the coloumn. Also fetch data to the
        elements present in popover.

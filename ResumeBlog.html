                        It is used to check files transferred from SAP server to Dealer Management System(DMS) and DMS
                        to SAP.

                        Sent the generated files to dealer server. And also receive files from dealer server and post
                        the datas present in files to SAP.

                        HTML is used to display just a content. There are 2 types of tag elements present in HTMl.
                        First one is semantic elements and second is non-semantic elements.
                        Semantic elements has purpose by its names. Examples: header, article, iframe, footer, etc.
                        Non-semantic elements does not have meaning about its content when used. Examples: div and span.

                        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. CSS is used for applying styles and make them as
                        responsive. CSS has many properties includes display, color and background, position, padding,
                        margin, width, border, box-sizing, etc. CSS have priority for elements,
                        classes, id, *(universal selector) and inline styles. * => tag => classes => id
                        => inline styles. * is least priority and inline styles has higher priority.
                        Responsive design given by flex, bootstrap and media queries.

                    <h5>JavaScript</h5>
                    JavaScript is used to add functionality to web elements. There are three main parts in JS.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Synchronous JS</li>
                        <li>Asynchronous JS</li>
                        <li>Window and Document Object Model</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Synchronous JS unblocks only when cuurent task is completed. Examples: basic codes, functions,
                        loops, conditions are Synchronous. Asynchronous JS execution starts in parallel without
                        blocking. But execution finishese one by one. Examples of Asynchronous are timers,
                        promises and thenables. Async and await has synchronous behavior but works asynchronously.
                        Await wait for promise to resolve and async function always return promise.
                        Window object have many inbuilt methods such as alert, console, print, prompt, open, etc.
                        By using document object model(DOM), we can take elements, set attributes, text content, append
                        child and also give styles.

                    <h5>React JS</h5>
                    <p>
                        In Js, accessing DOM is slow when there are many nested elements present in html. So facebook
                        introduced React which uses Virtual DOM.Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of actual DOM
                        present as JS object in memory. When a state is changed react take snapshot of virtual DOM befor
                        update and then virtual DOM updated. Then react compares the virtual DOM snapshot and updated
                        virtual DOM. This process is called diffing. ReactDOM updates only the changed state without
                        refreshing entire page. Only the changed content is updated. This is called reconciliation.
                        React makes use of JSX(JavaScript XML) to write HIML inside JS file of React.
                        There are two types of component in React, Class and Functional components.
                        Before version 16.8, state can be defined and updated using class component only. But in class
                        component, code strcuture is large. So in October 2018 at React conference, react hooks
                        was introduced for to include states in functional components.
                        Then after that code size reduced considerably. Advantages of React are speed, code reusability,
                        easier to debug using React Developer tools.

                    TAFE(Tractors And Farm Equipment limited) manufactures tractors, parts, store oil and eicher
                    vehicles. I had joined as Project Assinee in Dealer Management System.
                    Two flow of datas needs to be monitored. First one is outflow of data from SAP to dealers:
                    reconciliation of data from SAP to Dealer server for Invoices of tractors and dealers,
                    parts, oil, rollout new dealers, control unit mapping for dealers and workers,
                    pricing and warranty. Second flow from dealer server to SAP: status files such delivery,
                    retail, delivery return, retail return, sale order, purchase order and
                    service invoice files came from dealer server and transferred through
                    SFTP(Secured File Transfer Protocol) and posted to SAP by Remote Function Call(RFC).

                    First task was fetching data from API using React JS for

                    In college, I have done mini project named Tone generator control using 555 timer is used to produce
                    a range of sounds. By handling the two potentiometers of the tone generator,
                    you can change the oscillation frequencies of the two 555 timers
                    that work as astable multivibrators, thus generating different sounds. Used to convert
                    electrical signal to audio.
